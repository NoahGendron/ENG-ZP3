<h3>Harassment in the Computer Science Field</h3>

<p>
    Crunch and Crunch Culture may be one of the Computer Science field's worst aspects, there is something else that, for certain people, is worse.
    Workplace harassment is widely common in the field. In fact, "Nearly three out of four women in computer-related jobs report discrimination in the workplace."
    <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/1/9/16870120/women-discrimination-pew-research-computer-job-workplace-harassment-stem"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The field being predominantly made up of
    men, this may seem to be easily explained, however, that does not cover the extent of the matter.
</p>

<p>
    Recent high-profile cases, such as the lawsuit filed by the state of California against Activision Blizzard,
    have highlighted the toxic culture that infests the computer science industry, bringing to the forefront the urgent
    need for systemic change.

    In the realm of computer science, workplace harassment encompasses a broad spectrum of behaviors, from subtle microaggressions
    to overt discrimination, creating an environment that alienates and marginalizes individuals based on gender, race, or
    other protected characteristics.


</p>

<p>
    The "frat-boy" culture, as shown by the Activision-Blizzard case, is a manifestation of deeply ingrained biases that
    contribute to a toxic workplace environment. This culture often involves sexist jokes, misogyny, and a general
    lack of professionalism. It creates a hostile environment that makes it challenging for underrepresented
    groups, particularly women in the Computer Science field, to thrive. While the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard is a recent and high-profile example, it serves as a only one of the many examples of a much larger problem.


</p>
    Unfortunately, sexual harassment is another facet of workplace mistreatment within the field. Instances of boundary-breaking
    advances, inappropriate comments, and, in extreme cases, sexual assault have been reported numerous times throughout the years. The
    power dynamics inherent in hierarchical structures exacerbate the vulnerability of victims, often discouraging them from
    reporting incidents for fear of being black-listed from promotions or having your professional reputation damaged.

    Again, the recent lawsuit against gaming giant Activision-Blizzard serves as an important example of the core issues
    within the video game industry. The state of California itself accused the company of fostering this "frat-boy" culture mentioned above,
    where female employees faced systemic gender-based discrimination, harassment, and unequal pay. Reports detailed instances
    of inappropriate behavior, ranging from lewd comments to a pervasive atmosphere that trivialized and demeaned women.
    The CEO of Activision-Blizzard, Bobby Kotick, has also threatened to kill his secretary, and he has stated that he "deeply regret[ted it]."
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-reportedly-threatened-former-assistant-killed-2021-11#:~:text=CEO%20Bobby%20Kotick-,Activision%20CEO%20Bobby%20Kotick%20threatened%20to%20have%20his%20former%20assistant,and%20rape%20at%20his%20company."><sup>[12]</sup></a>
    This case not only exposed the mistreatment of female employees but also shed light on the core issue of gender inequality
    and harassment that is so present in the industry.
<p>

</p>

<p>
    Additionally, workplace harassment in computer science extends beyond gender-based discrimination, it also includes racial and
    ethnic discrimination. Individuals from marginalized communities often face stereotypes, biases, and exclusionary practices
    that hinder their professional growth. Recent incidents have exposed instances of racial discrimination and microaggressions, again,
    highlighting the need for systemic changes, and perhaps not just for this field in particular.

    Addressing workplace harassment in the computer science field is however not easy. It requires a change of not just policies, but of culture and accountability.
     If issues are to be permanently resolved, their source, their origin, is what needs to be addressed.
    Companies must implement rigid anti-harassment policies, and establish clear reporting mechanisms to create a safe and inclusive workplace.
    While this may not be achieved by the companies themselves, widespread governmental intervention could circumvent this. Additionally,
    encouraging a culture of diversity and inclusion, where individuals from all backgrounds are respected and valued, is crucial
    to eliminating the toxic norms that have long been present in the first place.
