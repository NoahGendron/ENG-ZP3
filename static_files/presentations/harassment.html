<h3>Harassment in the Computer Science Field</h3>

<p>

    Other than themselves and their employers, there are other things that can cause or encourage Crunch Culture for computer science programmers.
     The most important one is in the video games industry, where fans of the game franchise eagerly anticipate the project developers are working on.


    In all fields of computer science however, project development is always structured the same. Before development on an application, video game or website even starts, it can be very difficult
    to accurately predict the amount of time and money that will be required to be spent. The <a href="../../glossary#Feature" id="Feature">feature</a> and their <a href="../../glossary#Implement" id="Implement">implementation</a> into a product involve too many uncertainties since there isn't just one blueprint to follow.
    <a href="../..//glossary#Bugs" id="Bugs">Bugs</a> of all kinds can appear and nearly halt development depending on their impact. Sometimes, certain planned features become impossible due to an <a href="../../glossary#Engine" id="Engine">engine</a>'s
    limitations. Unforeseen problems can not just set a developer's progress back for several hours, they can
    even potentially halt progress of the entire project for weeks. Even then, once a project is finished, nothing guarantees that the final product will satisfy the
    <a href="../..//glossary#PO" id="PO">product owner</a>. This may lead to  a complete rebuilding of the project, if the project isn't entirely cancelled, hundreds of hours of work can still be scrapped.

<h3>The Consequences </h3>
<p>
    Despite all of those things, there is another, more prominent, cause of Crunch that has been left unmentioned in these lectures until now.
    This cause is so important that it dwarves every single other cause mentioned so far in comparison. The cause is pressure, not just peer pressure, but pressure from the fans.

    Talk about backlash
