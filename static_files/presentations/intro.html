With the rise of technology during the past decade, the field of computer science has been steadily expanding and will surely not 
cease soon. Consequently, the number of jobs in the industry have been on the rise as well, giving millions of
programmers and developer full-time employment. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean that the working conditions 
in the profession are ideal . Specifically, in the non-unionized computer science fields, where unexpected 
issues are frequent, it becomes difficult to reasonably estimate the time needed to complete a project, or if 
the project is even possible. This leads to employees or employers forcing themselves or forcing others to 
work much more than they should and do a ridiculous amount of overtime. This phenomenon happens to be the 
focal point of this project, targeting Crunch, or Crunch Culture, and by extension, the exploitation of 
programmers . However, there exist many other problems beyond Crunch, like the harassment of developers in the
workplace, especially towards women, which can be explained without a doubt by the high male demographics. 
These problems may be known by some, but “[…] there doesn’t exist a coherent, robust, and complete study 
gathering all the information and linking all of it together […] “. The goal of this project is therefore to
gather all these issues together and create a public repertory containing detailed in-depth documentation 
of coherent and comprehensible texts on the subject.
