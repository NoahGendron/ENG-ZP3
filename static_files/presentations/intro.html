<h3>What is Crunch?</h3>

<p>
    Crunch itself, is the action of pushing yourself, in computer science, and especially game development, this is usually defined by 
    working very long hours. This is often caused by the need to meet a strict deadline, like a development team's inability to 
    achieve specific milestones in time for a schedule. Programmers are pressured to work very long hours of overtime, which can be
    unpaid,<a href="https://umarhassan96.medium.com/explainer-what-is-crunch-culture-and-how-does-it-affect-video-game-studios-3f7d40d1b08f"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 
    since payments may require programmers to meet said milestones.<a href="https://cjc.utpjournals.press/doi/10.22230/cjc.2006v31n3a1771"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
    What makes Crunch in the field stand out howevere, is that it can last for excrutiatingly long periods of time. 
    Developers can always just avoid working overtime, it isn't necessarily always legally obligated for them to crunch,
    but it is nearly always an expectation. This expectation comes from an external source, mostly referred to as Crunch Culture.

<h3>The difference between Crunch and Crunch Culture</h3>

<p>
    Crunch Culture is often used to describe settings in the video games industry, as it is where Crunch is at its most prominent
    within the field of computer science. This may seem like it does not affect a lot of people, but there are over 47,000 people employed
    in the games industry, within the United Kingdom alone.<sup><a href="https://umarhassan96.medium.com/explainer-what-is-crunch-culture-and-how-does-it-affect-video-game-studios-3f7d40d1b08f">[3]</a></sup> 
     Within the confines of Crunch Culture, developers are <b>forced</b>, directly or indirectly,
    to work overtime for what can amount to 80-100 hour weeks. If the developer is a contractor, that overtime will remain unpaid, as their salary 
    is not affected by the number of hours they spend on the job. Failing to spend those hours leads to unlikely chances of having 
    a contract renewed and being hired again. What specifically differentiates this from Crunch time, is that Crunch Culture
    normalizes this practice, and carries it out for long periods of time, from several months, to several years even. This is where the problem comes from,
    Crunch Culture suggests that regularly staying up late, working tirelessly on a project, is a good thing, and is greatly encouraged, 
    even expected from those in the field. In the rare cases where Crunch isn't forced in one way or another, it still means that work 
    due for a certain deadline will have to be completed, and if a certain developer decides to take time off, that means that extra work will fall into 
    other people's hands,<sup><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/23/18507750/fortnite-work-crunch-epic-games">[4]</a></sup>
     which obviously reinforces the idea that Crunch is required to work in the industry. 
    <br><br>
    As an example of Crunch Culture, the head developer of <cite>Callisto Protocol</cite>, Glen Schofield, 
    <cite>"I only talk about the game during an event," he wrote on Twitter on Saturday. â€œWe r working 6-7 days a week, nobody's forcing us. Exhaustion, tired, Covid but we're working. Bugs, glitches, perf fixes.
     1 last pass thru audio. 12-15 hr days. This is gaming. Hard work. Lunch, dinner working. U do it cause ya luv it.".</cite> <sup><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-09-09/video-game-executive-faces-backlash-over-comments-about-crunch#xj4y7vzkg">[5]</a></sup>
     In the end, despite all the efforts him and his team made, that did not guarantee his company a good product. 
    At release, <cite>Callisto Protocol</cite> received very mixed reviews, not even receiving an average of seven out of ten 
    from both critics and players alike. <sup><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-callisto-protocol/">[6]</a></sup>
    In fact, Crunch Culture cannot even guarantee a functional product, <cite>Cyberpunk 2077</cite> was the most anticipated video game 
    of 2020, with almost a decade of anticipation leading up to the release. Despite the fact that the game had been in development for four years,
    and the developers had been forced to crunch long before release, the game released in a <b>completely broken</b> state. It was nearly 
    unplayable on certain platforms.<sup><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/style/cyberpunk-2077-video-game-disaster.html">[7]</a></sup>
    <!--The excuse behind this behaviour is usually in the sake of a greater purpose, the chance at making a truly fantastic work of art,
    without pushing studios into bankrupcy, -->
