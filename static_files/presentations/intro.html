<h3>What is Crunch?</h3>

<p>
    Crunch itself, is the action of pushing yourself, in computer science, and especially game development, this is usually defined by 
    working very long hours. This is often caused by the need to meet a strict deadline, like a development team's inability to 
    achieve specific milestones in time for a schedule. Programmers are pressured to work very long hours of overtime, which can be
    unpaid,<a href="https://umarhassan96.medium.com/explainer-what-is-crunch-culture-and-how-does-it-affect-video-game-studios-3f7d40d1b08f"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 
    since payments may require to meet said milestones. <a href="https://cjc.utpjournals.press/doi/10.22230/cjc.2006v31n3a1771"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
    What makes Crunch in the field stand out howevere, is that it can last for excrutiatingly long periods of time. 
    Developers can always just avoid working overtime, it isn't necessarily always legally obligated for them to crunch,
    but it is nearly always an expectation. This expectation comes from an external source, mostly referred to as Crunch Culture.

<h3>The difference between Crunch and Crunch Culture</h3>

<p>
    Crunch Culture is often used to describe settings in the video games industry, as it is where Crunch is at its most prominent
    within the field of computer science. This may seem like it does not affect a lot of people, but there are over 47,000 people employed
    in the games industry, within the United Kingdom alone.<sup><a href="https://umarhassan96.medium.com/explainer-what-is-crunch-culture-and-how-does-it-affect-video-game-studios-3f7d40d1b08f">[3]</a></sup> 
     Within the confines of Crunch Culture, developers are <b>forced</b>, directly or indirectly,
    to work overtime for what can amount to 80-100 hour weeks. If the developer is a contractor, that overtime will remain unpaid, as their salary 
    is not affected by the amount of hours they spend on the job. Failing to spend those hours leads to unlikely chances of having 
    a contract renewed and being hired again. What specifically differentiates this from Crunch time, is that Crunch Culture
    nromalizes this practice, and carries it out for long periods of time, from several months, to several years even. This is where the problem comes from,
    Crunch Culture suggests that regularly staying up late, working tirelessly on a project, is actually a good thing, and is greatly encouraged, 
    even expected from those in the field. In the rare cases where Crunch isn't forced in one way or another, it still means that work 
    due for a certain deadline will have to be completed, and if a certain developer decides to take time off, that means that extra work will fall into 
    other people's hands,
    <sup><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/23/18507750/fortnite-work-crunch-epic-games">[4]</a></sup> which obviously reinforces the idea 
    that Crunch is required to work in the industry. 
    <br><br
    As an example of Crunch Culture, the head developer of <cite>Callisto Protocol</cite>. In the end, despite all the efforts him and his team made, that did not guarantee
    him a good product. At release, <cite>Callisto Protocol</cite> received very mixed reviews, from both critics and players alike. 
    In fact, Crunch Culture cannot even guarantee a functional product 
    <!--The excuse behind this behaviour is usually in the sake of a greater purpose, the chance at making a truly fantastic work of art,
    without pushing studios into bankrupcy, -->

<h3>What leads to Crunch and Crunch Culture?</h3>

<br><br>

With the rise of technology during the past decade, the field of computer science has been steadily expanding and will surely not 
cease soon. Consequently, the number of jobs in the industry have been on the rise as well, giving millions of
programmers and developer full-time employment. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean that the working conditions 
in the profession are ideal . Specifically, in the non-unionized computer science fields, where unexpected 
issues are frequent, it becomes difficult to reasonably estimate the time needed to complete a project, or if 
the project is even possible. This leads to employees or employers forcing themselves or forcing others to 
work much more than they should and do a ridiculous amount of overtime. This phenomenon happens to be the 
focal point of this project, targeting Crunch, or Crunch Culture, and by extension, the exploitation of 
programmers . However, there exist many other problems beyond Crunch, like the harassment of developers in the
workplace, especially towards women, which can be explained without a doubt by the high male demographics. 
These problems may be known by some, but “[…] there doesn’t exist a coherent, robust, and complete study 
gathering all the information and linking all of it together […] “. The goal of this project is therefore to
gather all these issues together and create a public repertory containing detailed in-depth documentation 
of coherent and comprehensible texts on the subject.
