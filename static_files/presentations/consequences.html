<h3>Other Causes of Crunch Culture</h3>

<p>
    Sleep deprivation.
    Forced into bad contracts/employment. 
    Bad work culture/environment. 

    Crunch itself is the action of pushing yourself, in computer science, and especially game development, this is usually 
    defined by working very long hours. This is often caused by the need to meet a strict deadline, like a development team's 
    inability to achieve specific milestones in time for a schedule. 
    Programmers are pressured to work very long hours of overtime, which can be unpaid,

     since payments may require programmers 
    to meet said milestones.<a href="https://cjc.utpjournals.press/doi/10.22230/cjc.2006v31n3a1771"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
     What makes Crunch in the field stand out, 
    however, is that it can last for excruciatingly long periods of time. Developers can always just avoid working overtime, 
    it isn't necessarily always legally obligated for them to crunch, but it is nearly always an expectation. This expectation 
    comes from an external source, mostly referred to as Crunch Culture.

<h3>The Main Consequences </h3>

<p>
    As an example of Crunch Culture, the head developer of <cite>Callisto Protocol</cite>, Glen Schofield, 
    "I only talk about the game during an event," he wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “We r working 6-7 days a week, nobody's forcing
     us. Exhaustion, tired, Covid but we're working. Bugs, glitches, perf fixes. 1 last pass thru audio. 12-15 hr days. This is 
     gaming. Hard work. Lunch, dinner, working. U do it cause ya luv it." <sup><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-09-09/video-game-executive-faces-backlash-over-comments-about-crunch#xj4y7vzkg">[4]</a></sup>
      In the end, despite all the efforts him and his 
     team made, that did not guarantee his company a good product. At release, <cite>Callisto Protocol</cite>l received very mixed reviews, not 
     even receiving an average of seven out of ten from both critics and players alike. <sup><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-callisto-protocol/">[5]</a></sup>
      In fact, Crunch Culture cannot even 
     guarantee a functional product, <cite>Cyberpunk 2077</cite> was the most anticipated video game of 2020, with almost a decade of
     anticipation leading up to the release. Despite the fact that the game had been in development for four years, and the 
     developers had been forced to crunch long before release, the game was released in a completely broken state. It was nearly 
     unplayable on certain platforms.<sup><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/style/cyberpunk-2077-video-game-disaster.html">[6]</a></sup>
