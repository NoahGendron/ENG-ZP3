<h3>Other Causes of Crunch Culture</h3>

<p>
    Other than themselves and their employers, there are other things that can cause or encourage Crunch Culture for computer science programmers.
     The most important one is in the video games industry, where fans of the game franchise eagerly anticipate the project developers are working on.


    In all fields of computer science however, project development is always structured the same. Before development on an application, video game or website even starts, it can be very difficult
    to accurately predict the amount of time and money that will be required to be spent. The <a href="../../glossary#Feature" id="Feature">feature</a> and their <a href="../../glossary#Implement" id="Implement">implementation</a> into a product involve too many uncertainties since there isn't just one blueprint to follow.
    <a href="../..//glossary#Bugs" id="Bugs">Bugs</a> of all kinds can appear and nearly halt development depending on their impact. Sometimes, certain planned features become impossible due to an <a href="../../glossary#Engine" id="Engine">engine</a>'s
    limitations. Unforeseen problems can not just set a developer's progress back for several hours, they can
    even potentially halt progress of the entire project for weeks. Even then, once a project is finished, nothing guarantees that the final product will satisfy the
    <a href="../..//glossary#PO" id="PO">product owner</a>. This may lead to  a complete rebuilding of the project, if the project isn't entirely cancelled, hundreds of hours of work can still be scrapped.

     <!--Notes:
     Fans. Leads to perfectionism
    Sleep deprivation.
    Forced into bad contracts/employment. 
    Bad work culture/environment.
     Getting a job in the industry is hard -->

<p>
    Game development jobs may be in high demand all over Canada<a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/marketreport/outlook-occupation/295919/ca"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
    , that does not mean that said demand cannot be met, far from it.
    It is easy to get a job in the market, since it is a very sought out job, it is very competitive.
    There are a lot of engineers that aspire to work for game companies, and very few that actually get to do so.
    Getting hired at one of the leading studios is a very competitive and challenging task, given that you need a lot of experience in order to even be worth considering.
    Said experience can be hard to acquire, especially since the most efficient way of gaining experience is to earn a job position in the first place. There are other ways, like making your own prototype games, however this may result in
    hundreds, if not thousands of unpaid hours working on something that is solely passion-driven, and, depending on the project, the end result may leave a lot to be desired if it was conceived by a single individual.
    Developers usually need to craft their own portfolio, filled with different examples that prove their coding skills. If a developer wants to make a portfolio including their own solo projects,
    they will not only need to make a portfolio website, but they will also need to make their own projects alone, which leads to handling every single step of development by themselves, and have the skills to do so, which include : coding, sound, music, animation, modeling, rigging, designing and more.
    Each skill representing a potential job position of its own.
</p>

<p>
    With hundreds of developers being willing to go so far as to do all of the above, and many others still willing to try to get hired regardless,
    supply in terms of game developers is high. At least for the inexperienced ones. Then, when the Crunch starts, and the hundred-hour work week hits, developers are very reluctant to quit.
    This is not just because their position was very hard to obtain in the first place, it is because work in entertainment is considered by many to be a <i>dream job</i>.
    Many young programmers, unaware of the working conditions, are immensely passionate about video games since they grew up playing them. Companies exploit that passion at a very young age. 

    And in teh rare cases where the developer actually decides to quit, This leads to a scenario where if a developer  ever seems to disagree with a studio's tendency to encourage Crunch Culture,
    they don't necessarily need to worry about replacing that employee. Unions are extremely rare in the games industry and corporate heads are known to being
    keen at the idea of stopping such things from ever happening. This means that companies never need to evolve or change, they can just cycle through different employees.
    this also leads to the median age of game developers being 38<a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/marketreport/outlook-occupation/295919/ca"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, since
    only the most talented and experienced are hired.

<h3>The True Cause </h3>
<p>
    Despite all of those things, there is one other, extremely prominent cause of crunch that has been left unmentioned until now.
    It is so important that it dwarves every single other cause mentioned so far in comparison.
</p>


<br>
<h3>The Main Consequences </h3>

<p>

    <!--
    Sleep deprivation.
    Forced back into bad contracts/employment. Loop/cycle (stay employed, be vulnerable, dont get hired if you dont crunch)
    Bad work culture/environment. Unhealthy mindset. -->
