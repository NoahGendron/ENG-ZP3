<h3>Other Causes of Crunch Culture</h3>

<p>
    Other than themselves and their employers, there are other things that can cause or encourage Crunch Culture for computer science programmers.
     The most important one is in the video games industry, where fans of the game franchise eagerly anticipate the project developers are working on.

    In all fields of computer science however, project development is always structured the same. Before development on an application, video game or website even starts, it can be very difficult
    to accurately predict the amount of time and money that will be required to be spent. The <a href="../../glossary#Feature" id="Feature">feature</a> and their <a href="../../glossary#Implement" id="Implement">implementation</a> into a product involve too many uncertainties since there isn't just one blueprint to follow.
    <a href="../..//glossary#Bugs" id="Bugs">Bugs</a> of all kinds can appear and nearly halt development depending on their impact. Sometimes, certain planned features become impossible due to an <a href="../../glossary#Engine" id="Engine">engine</a>'s
    limitations. Unforeseen problems can not just set a developer's progress back for several hours, they can
    even potentially halt progress of the entire project for weeks. Even then, once a project is finished, nothing guarantees that the final product will satisfy the
    <a href="../..//glossary#PO" id="PO">product owner</a>. This may lead to  a complete rebuilding of the project, if the project isn't entirely cancelled, hundreds of hours of work can still be scrapped.

<p>
    One reason why Crunch is so much more prominent in the game development compared to web development is that
    game development jobs may be in high demand all over Canada<a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/marketreport/outlook-occupation/295919/ca"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
    , that does not mean that said demand cannot be met, far from it. Since the medium of video games is enticing to so many, there are,
    unlike web developers, far more game developers trying to make games than the market can support, and not every product can be successful.
    It is easy to get a job on the market, since it is a very sought out job, it is very competitive, thus making the median age of game developers 38<a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/marketreport/outlook-occupation/295919/ca"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
    There are a lot of engineers that aspire to work for game companies, and very few that actually get to do so.
    Getting hired at one of the leading studios is a very competitive and challenging task, given that you need a lot of experience in order to even be worth considering.
    Said experience can be hard to acquire, especially since the most efficient way of gaining experience is to earn a job position in the first place. There are other ways, like making your own prototype games, however this may result in
    hundreds, if not thousands of unpaid hours working on something that is solely passion-driven, and, depending on the project, the end result may leave a lot to be desired if it was conceived by a single individual.
    Developers usually need to craft their own portfolio, filled with different examples that prove their coding skills. If a developer wants to make a portfolio including their own solo projects,
    they will not only need to make a portfolio website, but they will also need to make their own projects alone, which leads to handling every single step of development by themselves, and have the skills to do so, which include : coding, sound, music, animation, modeling, rigging, designing and more.
    Each skill representing a potential job position of its own.
</p>

<p>
    With hundreds of developers being willing to go so far as to do all of the above, and many others still willing to try to get hired regardless,
    supply in terms of game developers is high. At least for the inexperienced ones. Then, when the Crunch starts, and the hundred-hour work week hits, developers are very reluctant to quit.
    This is not just because their position was very hard to obtain in the first place, it is because work in entertainment is considered by many to be a <i>dream job</i>.
    Many young programmers, unaware of the working conditions, are immensely passionate about video games since they grew up playing them. Companies exploit that passion at a very young age.
    <br><br>
    And in the rare cases where the developer actually decides to quit, because of Crunch or any other poor working conditions,
    they don't necessarily need to worry about replacing that employee. Unions are extremely rare in the games industry and corporate heads are known to being
    keen at the idea of stopping such things from ever happening. This means that companies never need to evolve or change, they can just cycle through different employees.
    As for the developer, they can try looking for a new job in game development, and may find one if they are lucky, their
    application being more likely to be accepted given their experience, however unless they get a job at a smaller studio, chances are the cycle of Crunch and Crunch Culture will just repeat itself.
    The other option is to go back to change industries and get into web development, since most game developers usually have the skill set to do both.
    However, this is usually frowned upon, and companies will often overlook candidates with a lot of experience in other industries, since they prefer
    <br><br>
    A developer, may attempt to create their own game, independently of any outside studio and publisher, but this leads to financial problems and a lack of proper marketing.
    This approach can most likely lead to a lot more Crunch, because while there may not be a forced deadline for the project's release, independent studios are far smaller and have significantly less resources
    than large corporations do. If the studio lacks funds, the developers may depend on the game's financial success in order to
    pay their rent and meals in the future. Consequently, this approach is mostly reserved for workaholics willing to work tirelesssly,
    sometimes to accomplish multiple people's jobs at once, on the same project for years, without
    any guarantee that in the end said project will even make them any money at all. The gaming industry represents the most profitable entertainment medium in the world<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/24/briefing/game-worker-union.html"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
    Most of these issues can obviously be solved, workers can unionize to try and improve their own working conditions. However, the success of a prominent
    union within the gaming industry is rarely found. The creation and recognition of an industry's first union takes time, and the medium of video games is still very young, even when compared to cinema. According to an article from
    <i>The New York Times</i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/24/briefing/game-worker-union.html"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, it took until very recently for Microsoft, the industry's
    largest corporation<a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/video-games/largest-video-game-companies-by-market-cap/"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, and owner of numerous leading studios of the industry, to recognize its very first gaming union:
    "[Working] conditions have prompted more workers to move to unionize. This month, Microsoft recognized its first union after video game testers organized."
    As a matter of fact "Most game developers support unionization, a recent survey found."
    Activision-Blizzard, a company now recently acquired by Microsoft, has even tried to dismantle workers' attempts to unionize. Activision has in fact, illegally
    "been accused by a union of illegally firing two video game testers for using "strong language" in a protest of a new company policy that limits remote work."
    <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/activision-fired-staff-using-strong-language-about-remote-work-policy-union-2023-03-01/"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
    Companies fight against unions because exploiting their employees is more profitable, this is the origin of Crunch,
    which is essential and if that comes at the cost of the health of its employees then so be it, they are considered replaceable.

<h3>The True Cause </h3>
<p>
    Despite all of those things, there is another, more prominent, cause of Crunch that has been left unmentioned in these lectures until now.
    This cause is so important that it dwarves every single other cause mentioned so far in comparison. The cause is pressure, not just peer pressure,
    but pressure from the fans, potentially leading to perfectionism.

    While the gaming industry thrives on the  passion of its consumers, it is also this very enthusiasm that can lead to pressuring and even harassing developers.
    Fans, driven by an insatiable desire for the new life-changing experience from their favourite brand,
    often find themselves unintentionally contributing to the very origin of Crunch Culture, the core of the issue. Some fans even find themselves insinuating that Crunch is <b>required</b> in order to make a good looking game...
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/g3f5wgk7ilm41.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=eef43d51def0b05ce4da79abe60bd580912481ba" alt="Crunch vs No Crunch on Twitter">
    <br><br>
    The expectations set by fans, are a significant source of pressure on developers, who, not unlike the fans, . The hunger for perfection and the incessant demand for the next innovative title create an environment where developers operate under perpetual stress to meet the soaring expectations of the gaming community. This external pressure, sometimes amplified through social media, not only influences the development process but also contributes to the prevalence of crunch, as developers strive to fulfill the lofty demands of an audience eagerly awaiting the next gaming masterpiece.

    Harassment, unfortunately, has become an alarming byproduct of direct fan interaction with developers, facilitated by the accessibility provided by social media platforms. While many fans engage positively, a subset resorts to vitriolic attacks and unwarranted criticisms. Developers, particularly those from marginalized groups, often find themselves at the receiving end of sexist, racist, or simply aggressive comments. This toxic fan behavior, fueled by an overwhelming sense of entitlement, exacerbates the already challenging landscape for developers.

    The hype culture surrounding video games, fueled by fan speculation, leaks, and an unquenchable thirst for information, contributes to the perpetuation of unrealistic expectations. Fans, in their eagerness for the next big release, inadvertently place immense pressure on developers to deliver a product that lives up to the heightened anticipation. Disappointment, which is almost inevitable in such a hyperbolic environment, can lead to backlash and further strain the developer-fan relationship.

    In essence, the very passion that sustains the gaming industry becomes a double-edged sword. The dedication of fans, while instrumental in the industry's growth,
    inadvertently contributes to the challenges faced by developers. Balancing this passion with responsible engagement becomes imperative to foster a healthier gaming
    environment, one that values the well-being of its creators as much as it does the enjoyment of its audience. The symbiotic relationship between fans and developers
    is a complex interplay that requires a nuanced understanding to ensure the continued prosperity of the gaming
    industry.

    <!--
    Sleep deprivation.
    Forced back into bad contracts/employment. Loop/cycle (stay employed, be vulnerable, dont get hired if you dont crunch)
    Bad work culture/environment. Unhealthy mindset. -->
