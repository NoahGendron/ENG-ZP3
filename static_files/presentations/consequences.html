<h3>Other Causes of Crunch Culture</h3>

<p>
    Other than themselves and their employers, there are other things that can cause or encourage Crunch Culture for computer science programmers.
     The most important one is in the video games industry, where fans of the game franchise eagerly anticipate the project developers are working on.


    In all fields of computer science however, project development is always structured the same. Before development on an application, video game or website even starts, it can be very difficult
    to accurately predict the amount of time and money that will be required to be spent. The <a href="../../glossary#Feature" id="Feature">feature</a> and their <a href="../../glossary#Implement" id="Implement">implementation</a> into a product involve too many uncertainties since there isn't just one blueprint to follow.
    <a href="../..//glossary#Bugs" id="Bugs">Bugs</a> of all kinds can appear and nearly halt development depending on their impact. Sometimes, certain planned features become impossible due to an <a href="../../glossary#Engine" id="Engine">engine</a>'s
    limitations. Unforeseen problems can not just set a developer's progress back for several hours, they can
    even potentially halt progress of the entire project for weeks. Even then, once a project is finished, nothing guarantees that the final product will satisfy the
    <a href="../..//glossary#PO" id="PO">product owner</a>. This may lead to  a complete rebuilding of the project, if the project isn't entirely cancelled, hundreds of hours of work can still be scrapped.

     <!--Notes:
     Fans. Leads to perfectionism
    Sleep deprivation.
    Forced into bad contracts/employment. 
    Bad work culture/environment.
     Getting a job in the industry is hard -->

    Developers in the games industry may be in high demand, that does not mean that it is easy to get a job in the market.
    There are a lot of engineers that aspire to work for game companies, and very few that actually get to do so.
    Getting hired at one of the leading studios is a very competitive and challenging task, given that you need a lot of experience in order to even be worth considering.
    Said experience can be hard to acquire, especially since the most efficient way of gaining experience is to earn a job position in the first place. There are other ways, like making your own prototype games, however this may result in
    hundreds, if not thousands of unpaid hours working on something that is solely passion-driven, and, depending on the project, the end result may leave a lot to be desired if it was conceived by a single individual.
    Developers usually need to craft their own portfolio, filled with different examples that prove their coding skills. If a developer wants to make a portfolio including their own solo projects,
    they will not only need to make a portfolio website, but they will also need to make their own projects alone, which leads to handling every single step of development by themselves, and have the skills to do so, which include : coding, sound, music, animation, modeling, rigging, designing and more.
    Each skill representing a potential job position of its own.

<h3>The True Cause </h3>
<p>
    Despite all of those things, there is one other, extremely prominent cause of crunch that has been left unmentioned until now.
    It is so important that it dwarves every single other cause mentioned so far in comparison.
</p>


<br>
<h3>The Main Consequences </h3>

<p>

    <!--
    Sleep deprivation.
    Forced back into bad contracts/employment. Loop/cycle (stay employed, be vulnerable, dont get hired if you dont crunch)
    Bad work culture/environment. Unhealthy mindset. -->
